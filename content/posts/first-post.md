If I remember correctly, my last blog posting was 4 years ago in my personal blog that's already dead (sayafanni.web.id). Since then I'm just writing and documenting what I've done in a notes with a mess structure of writing or sometimes only a bunch of keywords that I forgot what it's all about in the next day.

So, because of those reasons, I will going back to write my experiences in a proper writing format and also publish it, just in case if there are people who are facing the same problem like I did.

And as a non native English speaker, I will make this blog as my writing exercise, so please bear with me :)
